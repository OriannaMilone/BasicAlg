#Minimax alg --> Applied in Tic Tac Toe

#Three possible outcomes: Win = 1
#                         Lose = -1
#                         Tie = 0

#We have two agents/players (X & O)
#We'll call X = Max Player MAX(X)  --> aims to maximize the score 
#And   call O = Min Player MIN(O)  --> aims to minimize the score
# Meaning, that the notion of: Winnig and Losing, its now a mathematical approach to, choosing
# bigger or lower scenarios (Three possible outcomes)
